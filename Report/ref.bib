abstract = {Mobile sensing denotes the use of mobile devices and their integrated sensors for sensing and learning physical and social phenomena, and to use derived information for sharing, informing, and persuading humans. From the perspective of software architecture, mobile sensing bears several design challenges regarding, e.g., use of battery powered mobile devices, and collection and processing of sensor data. In this paper, we present tactics to address these architecture design challenges. We discuss the two architectural qualities energy efficiency and resource adaptability, and describe themusing general scenario-generation tables to support the systematic specification of architecture requirements. Furthermore, we develop a catalog of architectural tactics distilled from literature to enable developers to systematically apply proven methods. For each tactic, we provide examples to relate the respective tactics to particular cases illustrating their use in practice. Finally, we provide a preliminary validation of the proposed. systematized tactics catalog, which was conducted with student teams. Our preliminary findings show that the tactics are beneficial to provide a guideline and to create awareness of the special challenges of energy-efficient and resource-adaptable architecture design},

The approach is based on a “3+1” structure in which three viewpoints on the described system are used – module, component {\&} connector, and allocation – are used to describe a solution for a set of architectural requirements.},

@article{Huotari2012,
abstract = {During recent years “gamification” has gained significant attention among practitioners and game scholars. However, the current understanding of gamification has been solely based on the act of adding systemic game elements into services. In this paper, we propose a new definition for gamification, which emphases the experiential nature of games and gamification, instead of the systemic understanding. Furthermore, we tie this definition to theory from service marketing because majority of gamification implementations aim towards goals of marketing, which brings to the discussion the notion of how customer / user is always ultimately the creator of value. Since now, the main venue for academic discussion on gamification has mainly been the HCI community. We find it relevant both for industry practitioners as well as for academics to study how gamification can fit in the body of knowledge of existing service literature because the goals and the means of gamification and marketing have a significant overlap.},
