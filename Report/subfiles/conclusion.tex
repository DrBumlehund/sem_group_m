We have successfully implemented a prototype, with infrastructure capabilities for crowdsourcing of report validations. It does this by notifying end users, whenever they are geographically near a report, and allowing users to comment and confirm or deny reports. The prototype also allows users to create 

Thereâ€™s a lot of reports in Odense \cite{odense} and prioritizing the reports can become a tedious task. By letting users validate reports it gives the municipality a way of prioritizing reports. 

To keep users engaged work related to gamification has been considered. A suggestive leaderboard has been developed, but no logic has been implemented to make the leaderboard function. 

A battery consumption test using the application have been performed. While having the application in the background for 1 hour and 20 minutes the application increased the discharge rate (\% per hour) of 7\%. 


\subsection*{Future Works}
In the future it would be great to pursue the rest of the addressed problems, and implement the suggested solution for the prioritization problem, and the incentive problem.
It would also be interesting to work with other kinds of clients, such as the suggested web client, but also an iOS and maybe windows phone clients.
